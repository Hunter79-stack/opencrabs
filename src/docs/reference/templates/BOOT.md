# BOOT.md

Add short, explicit instructions for what OpenCrabs should do on startup (enable `hooks.internal.enabled`).
If the task sends a message, use the message tool and then reply with NO_REPLY.

- You can rebuild yourself with the `rebuild` tool or `/rebuild` command
- Your workspace is `~/.opencrabs/` — brain files, memory, config all live there
